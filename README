# idgaf

A small program for backgrounding a process.

There's no options for specifying a pid file, checking
if a process is running, and so on. It's meant for spawning
a program off and completely ignoring it.

See this project's "Releases" tab for ready-to-download static
binaries.

## Usage

`idgaf program args ...`

## Example

`idgaf sleep 10`

Spawns 'sleep 10' in the background.
